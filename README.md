**Supply-Chain-Order-Backlogs-Analysis**

The Dataset used in this project was that of a superstore containing orders made by different customers in the year 2013. Analysis was done on the dataset to gain insights and make effective decision-making. The tool used to perform this task was Microsoft Excel. With Excel, I was able to perform steps that included the following

I. Data Cleaning

II. Data Processing

III. Data Analysis

IV. Data Visualization

**DATA CLEANING**

Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to improve its quality and reliability for analysis or modeling. This typically involves tasks such as removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, correcting data formatting issues, and detecting and rectifying outliers. In the dataset, it was discovered that several duplicate data was found. All columns were converted to the correct data format and all missing values were solved by dropping the rows that contained the missing values.

**DATA PROCESSING**

Data processing refers to the manipulation and transformation of raw data into a more useful format or structure. It involves tasks such as sorting, summarizing, aggregating, filtering, and transforming data to extract meaningful insights or support decision-making.

In the dataset, the following columns were created by applying the correct formulas to be able to extract more meaningful insights

I. Order Year

II. Order Month

III. Order Day

IV. Order Hour

**DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION**

Data analysis involves interpreting data to extract insights, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to visually communicate insights, trends, and patterns. It involves creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help understand complex data sets and present findings clearly and understandably. Data visualization enhances understanding and aids in decision-making by making data more accessible and intuitive to interpret.

The following Business questions were asked and answers were discovered
1. How does delivery delay correlate with customers feedback?
2. Which drivers have the highest average delay?
3. Which routes are the most problematic in terms of delivery delays?
4. Are certain types of vehicles associated with higher delays?
5. How do 'Expedited Rules' perform compared to 'Custom Rules' in terms of delay?
